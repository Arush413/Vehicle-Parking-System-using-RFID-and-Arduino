# Vehicle-Parking-System-using-RFID-and-Arduino
This project is an attempt to develop an automatic parking system which can provide a faster and efficient way to allot and manage the available space in parking lots.<br>
For achieveing this, we used an Arduino board and RFID sensor to detect the vehicles coming in and to check whether there is an empty spot in the parking lot. If there are empty spaces and the vehicle is authorised, the vehicle is let inside the parking lot.
